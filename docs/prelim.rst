About Python
------------

Python is a popular general-purpose programming language that has been used 
for a broad range of applications.  
Dropbox, for example, is written entirely in Python.  

We think Python is the language of choice right now if you want a user-friendly 
introduction to programming and a useful tool for day-to-day work.  
It has a  broad range of applications and an enormous community of users, 
which you'll find are incredibly valuable resources.  
And it's free and open source. 
Free means you pay nothing.  
Open source means if you want to see how something works, you can look at the code.  

The closest competitors to Python are probably Matlab and R. 
We've used Matlab for years.  It was great in 1990, and we still use it for some things, 
but it's missing many of the features of more modern languages.  
It's not easy, for example, to read data straight from the internet. 
And the thing that bugs us a lot:  functions must be stand-alone files.  
It's also expensive.  Outside universtities, 
they seem to price it with investment banks in mind.  

R would be our second choice.  
Like Python, it's free.
It's the leading program among professional statisticians and has lots of 
packages aimed at stats work.  
We think it's a great program, and does lots of things, but it's not a general-purpose
programming language. 
If you want to try it out, let us know, we can point you to some resources.   


That leaves us with Python.  
Although it's a general purpose language, 
we'll use it it for data work.
Our focus is economic and financial data, but the same methods 
-- and more -- can be applied to data from any source, 
including proprietary data at your company.  
One of our former students is using it to study patterns of 
survival on the 
`Titanic <http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted>`_
and Neilsen television ratings. 
Another is using it to 
`process text <http://www.nltk.org/>`_ from news sources and analyst reports.  
Thanks to 
`AQR and others <http://pandas.pydata.org/community.html#history-of-development>`_, 
the data analytic toolsets in Python now rival stat-focused languages like R.

Before the first class
----------------------

We'll make faster progress if you 
(i) install Python on your computer   
and (ii) think about the kinds of projects you'd like to work on.
More on each  below.
