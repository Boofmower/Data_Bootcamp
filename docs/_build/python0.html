<h1>Installing Python<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-python" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Python is a popular general-purpose programming language that has been used
for a broad range of applications.
Dropbox, for example, is written entirely in Python.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll use Python to study economic and financial data, but the same methods
&#8211; and more &#8211; can be applied to data from any source.
One of our former students is using it to study patterns of
survival on the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted">Titanic</a>.
Another is using it to
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.nltk.org/">process text</a> from analyst reports.
Thanks to
<a class="reference external" href="http://pandas.pydata.org/community.html#history-of-development">AQR and others</a>,
the data analytic toolsets in Python now rival stat-focused languages like R.</p>
<p>There are lots of ways to use Python, but we recommend two.
Don&#8217;t get cute, just follow these directions.</p>
<div class="section" id="python-on-the-cloud">
<h2>Python on the cloud<a class="headerlink" href="#python-on-the-cloud" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The easiest way to get started with Python is to run it on the cloud with
<a class="reference external" href="https://wakari.io/">Wakari</a>.
Just click on the link and sign up for an account.
In our experience, it&#8217;s virtually instantaneous.
Wakari runs IPython Notebooks, which are a combination of Python code and text,
with the code executable in chunks.  The text allows us to document what we&#8217;re doing as we go.
A former student (one who is reasonably tech savvy) writes:  &#8220;IPython seems best for beginners.
The structure almost forces good documentation and you can build the script over time versus building
and running it all at once.&#8221;  That&#8217;s not our view, but it&#8217;s a reasonable one.</p>
<p>One downside is that the Wakari default uses an older version of Python that
does not allow some of the newer web tools for data input.
The interface for Yahoo Options data, for example, doesn&#8217;t quite work (close, but not quite).
We can probably tell Wakari to use a newer version,
or write a workaround for this version, but we&#8217;re not there yet.
Another downside is that the server is sometimes too busy to execute your code.
An asterisk appears to the left of the code segment and nothing happens.
Sometimes it goes away, sometimes not.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to give Wakari a try, set up an account.
It&#8217;s pretty close to self-explanatory.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="python-on-your-computer">
<h2>Python on your computer<a class="headerlink" href="#python-on-your-computer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We prefer this, but it&#8217;s trickier to set up.
Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s involved:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Download and install the Anaconda distribution of Python.</strong>
Anaconda is a combination of
basic Python and toolsets called packages &#8211; what aficionados call a &#8220;code distribution.&#8221;
Anaconda has all the basics and covers almost all of what we plan to do.
It has options for most operating systems (Windows, Mac OS, Linux, all of various vintages)
and versions of Python (we use version 3.4).
TO install it, follow these steps:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Download the installer.</em> Click on
<a class="reference external" href="http://continuum.io/downloads">this link</a>.
Below the words &#8220;Download Anaconda&#8221; you&#8217;ll see in caps:  &#8220;CHOOSE YOUR INSTALLER.&#8221;
To the right you&#8217;ll see three logos and the words &#8220;I WANT PYTHON 3.4.&#8221;
First, choose your computer&#8217;s operating system by clicking on the appropriate logo
(window panes, apple, or penguin).
The site usually guesses this, which you can tell because the appropriate logo
will be blue rather than gray.
Second, click on &#8220;I WANT PYTHON 3.4.&#8221;
Yup, only the newest and best for you!
Finally, immediately below the words &#8220;CHOOSE YOUR INSTALLER&#8221;
you&#8217;ll see a box with words like &#8220;[Op System] 64-bit / Python 3.4 / Graphical Installer.&#8221;
Click on it to download the installer.</li>
<li><em>Install Python.</em>  Once you&#8217;ve downloaded the installer, click on it and follow the instructions.
This is no different from any other installation you&#8217;ve done.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2:  Run Python.</strong>
You should now have Python on your computer.
There are two ways to run it, Spyder (recommended) and IPython (same as Wakari, but on your computer):</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Spyder. Our preferred method.
We&#8217;d like to say:
Start it up as you would any program.
That&#8217;s intentionally glib, we&#8217;ve had difficulty finding the on button in some environments,
but there&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all solution, every operating system is different.
In Windows 7, for example, installation usually puts a Spyder icon on the desktop.
Click on it and you&#8217;re good to go.
In Windows 8.1, we managed to locate Spyder in the apps, but it&#8217;s well hidden and took us a while.</p>
<p>Once you get Spyder running, you&#8217;ll have a pretty standard graphical user interface,
similar to what you&#8217;d have with Matlab or R (RStudio, for example).
There&#8217;s an editor, typically on the left, where you can write and edit code.
There are buttons at the top for running it.
There&#8217;s an IPython console where you can try out commands or ask for help.
We&#8217;ll do a lot of this, but not right now.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">IPython.  To create or run an IPython Notebook, you need to do something like:
go to the command line and type &#8216;ipython notebook&#8217;.
This will open a tab in your browser where you can write and execute IPython notebooks.
The opening screen is a directory, but you can open a new or old notebook
and navigate through the directory and save it wherever you like.
It will look just like Wakari,
but you&#8217;ll be running IPython on your computer with whatever version of Python you have installed.
As with Spyder, getting it going is harder in some systems than others.  Good luck!</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="advice">
<h2>Advice<a class="headerlink" href="#advice" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a steep learning curve at the start of any effort like this.
You&#8217;ll get through it, but it takes patience and persistence.  We suggest:</p>
<p><strong>Take your time.</strong>  This won&#8217;t happen overnight.  But it won&#8217;t take weeks, either,
before you&#8217;re doing cool things.</p>
<p><strong>Ask for help.</strong>  This is much easier to do if you have friends doing the same thing.
Or even better, friends who are ahead of you.  You&#8217;ll probably find that you need a lot of help at the start,
but once you get going you&#8217;ll be able to help yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Google fu.</strong>  Once you&#8217;ve made some progress, you can learn a lot just by Googling your issue.
The best links are often the Python documentation and Stack Overflow.</p>
<p><strong>Start from examples.</strong>  The easiest place to start is with programs that work.
Start with one  and tweak it till you get what you want.
Play around with the details and see what happens.
The documentation includes lots of examples.
And we&#8217;ll have lots of examples of our own.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="references-and-more">
<h2>References and more<a class="headerlink" href="#references-and-more" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html">Python tutorial</a>.
The basics of the language presented in a user-friendly way.
Start up Python and copy what they do there.
Note, too, the box in the upper left corner for the version of Python you&#8217;re using.
We&#8217;ll stick with Version 3.4 for now, but the major differences are between Python 2.x
and 3x.  Avoid 2.x unless you really know what you&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/">Spyder interface</a>.
We&#8217;ll go over this in class, but you can skim through the documentation yourself.
The key components:  (i) On the left is an editor where you write programs.
(ii) In the lower right corner, there&#8217;s what they call an IPython console, where you can type
in commands one at a time to see what they do.
(iii) In the upper right corner there&#8217;s what they call the Object inspector, which gives you access
to documentation about specific commands.  Type in the command and its documentation pops up.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/interactive/tutorial.html">IPython tutorial</a>.
We recommend you use Spyder.  If you want to run code in small chunks, you can do that.
But if you nevertheless decide to use IPython, here&#8217;s where you start.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://quant-econ.net/py/learning_python.html">Quant Econ</a>.
The Sargent-Stachurski Quantitative Economics site has a really nice introduction
to Python.  It covers much of what we&#8217;ll do, but in a relatively terse way.
Their emphasis is on macroeconomic theory, but the early sections touch on data work.
We&#8217;ll do the same in (much) more detail.</p>
