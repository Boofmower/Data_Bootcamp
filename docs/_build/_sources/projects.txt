Python -- and computer languages in general -- are tools, 
and it's hard to know where to start with tools until you have some idea what you want to do with them.  
Our focus is data, but even there you might want to think about what
kinds of data you are interested in and what you would like to get out of it.  


Looking for ideas 
-----------------

**Applications and data sources**

If you're looking for ideas and examples, we've spent the better part of two years collecting 
`links to applications 
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L2ZDKFyyqfOrCGbNcCIE9mmgap4tjkTNuw32hK4c6BI/edit?usp=sharing>`_.
Take a look, see if anything there strikes your fancy.  
Also the links to blogs and quantitative journalism sites, 
some of which post their data and code online.
Here are some of our favorites.  Let us know yours and we'll add them.  

**Blogs**

`Python Weekly <http://www.pythonweekly.com/>`_. 
This is an aggregator, it reprints Python-related content from other sources.  
Pretty good, on the whole, but some of the content goes well beyond our interests.
You can sign up for weekly email delivery or access it in an RSS reader.  

`R bloggers <http://www.r-bloggers.com/>`_.  
Another aggregator.  The focus is on R applications, but they're very good. 
You might take one and convert it to Python.  

`Flowing data <http://flowingdata.com/>`_.
Data work with an emphasis on graphics.  

`Practical business Python <http://pbpython.com/>`_. 
From John Stachurski, we haven't had a chance to check it out yet. 

`VizWiz <http://vizwiz.blogspot.com/>`_.  
Really good "visualization" blog.  The author uses Tableau, but 
his comments about graphics go well beyond that.  

**Other sources**

`FiveThirtyEight <http://fivethirtyeight.com/>`_ 
has a lot of good quantitative journalism.
Better yet, they post a lot of their data and code in a 
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data>`_.
One of my favorites is 
`a study <http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/>`_
of income of young people by college major.
My summary:  quant skills pay, social work does not.  

`Kaggle <https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/Home>`_ 
posts problems and data, many of them in the form of competitions. 
Also has a collection of resources.

Managing a project
------------------

A project should address these issues, or something like them:  


**Clear goal.**  
For example, you might want a piece of work you can show potential 
employers to illustrate your analytical skills.  
Remember, the focus is on your skills, the application is probably secondary. 

**Sharp question.**  
What would you like to learn?  Is it knowable?  How will you know when you have an answer?  
What might an answer look like?  Generally the sharper the question, the sharper the answer.  
This is an iterative pra

**Data.**  
What data do you plan to use?  Is it public or proprietary?  How will you get it?  Have others used it?
Did they post it online?  
Once you have a data set, you can think about reverse engineering a project.
Ask yourself:  What can I do with this data that's interesting?  

**Tools.**  
What analytical tools do you plan to use?  Do you understand them?  Are they available in Python?  

**Final product.**  
What would you like your output to look like?  How do you plan to use it? 
Slides?  Report?  IPython presentation?  Something else?

**Keep it simple.** 
Projects tend to expand, so it's best to start simple.  
In fact, it's best to start simple anyway.
Take an example you've read about and tweak it.  
Would you do it differently?  Extend it in some way?  
Explore a tangent?  
Follow up with different data?  
You get the idea:  projects are organic,  you can develop them in any way you like.  

You can attack this in any order, but typically it's best to start with the final product 
(so you know what you're aiming for) 
and the data (to make sure what you're looking for exists).  
Don't look for a perfect project, they don't exist, and if they did you might not recognize them
anyway.  
Take one that has some appeal to you and play around with it, 
see if you can turn it into something really interesting.  
Bounce ideas off your friends.
