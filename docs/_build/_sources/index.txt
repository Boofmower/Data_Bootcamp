Material for a future course at NYU Stern using Python to study economic, financial, and business data. 
Most of it is intended for classroom use, which means it may be somewhat mysterious 
if you try to work through it on your own.  
And even more mysterious because it's at an early stage of development.

Course description 
------------------

This course is about the nuts and bolts data analysis.  
You will learn about economic, financial, and business data and 
enough about computer programming to make sense of it.  
Applications include some or all of:  leading economic indicators; country indicators; 
bond and equity returns; stock options; income by zip code; “long tail” sales data; 
innovation diffusion curves; attendance data for plays and sports teams; and many others.  
We will use Python, a popular high-level computer language that’s widely used in finance, consulting, 
and other parts of the business world.  “High-level” means that it’s less painful than most 
(the hard work is done by the language and its collection of tools), 
but it’s a serious language with extensive capabilities.  
“Analysis” means primarily 
graphical descriptions that summarize the properties of data in ways that are helpful to managers.  
“Bootcamp” is a reminder that you should come willing to work. 
It will be worth it, but there's no way to avoid doing some work.  


Questions you might have 
------------------------

**Why take this course?**  

It’s an investment in your future.  
You will be able to process data and communicate its content much 
more efficiently than with a spreadsheet program.  
And that’s a huge understatement.  After this course, you will be more valuable to 
current and future employers -- and Excel will remind you of doing arithmetic on your fingers.  

**What are the prerequisites?**  

There are none, other than the courage to take on a challenge 
and the patience to debug programs that don’t quite work -- and they never work the first time, 
and often not the second or third time either.  The course is designed for students with little or no programming experience.  
We will teach you what you need to know.  

**Are you exaggerating about patience?** 

No. If you don't have it, you should do something else.  
But if you stick with it, you'll have more power over information than you did before. 
Even so, you'll occasionally run into 
`situations that challenge your sanity
<http://junkcharts.typepad.com/numbersruleyourworld/2011/11/three-hours-in-the-life-of-a-glorified-data-scientist.html>`_. 
Remember, 
`grasshopper <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fu_(TV_series)#Overview>`_,  
enlightenment comes from working through challenges and overcoming them.  

**Where will this lead?**  

This course won't turn you into a quant on its own.  
But it will transform you into someone who can work well with quants and --
together with the rest of the program -- communicate effectively with executives.  
You will come out somewhere between Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill in 
“`Moneyball <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film)>`_," 
with a solid foundation for dealing with whatever data comes your way in business or life.  
You will also be well prepared to do more along similar lines, including the extensive collection 
of courses on business analytics and data science offered by our 
`IOMS group <http://www.stern.nyu.edu/experience-stern/about/departments-centers-initiatives/academic-departments/ioms-dept/>`_.  
It's cool stuff, you should check it out.  

**Should I take this course if I already know how to code?**  

Probably not, there are more advanced options that would suit you better.  
If you take it anyway, please don’t scare the other students.  


Acknowledgements
----------------

We owe big thank-you's to Chase Coleman and Spencer Lyon, aka Sargent's Python Team, and Paul Backus; 
they're our go-to advisors on technical issues.  
Sarah Beckett-Hile is rapidly adding to our collection of applications 
and proves that English majors can code as well as anyone.  
You may also notice a resemblance to Tom Sargent and John Stachurski's 
`Quantitative Economics <http://quant-econ.net/>`_, 
a wonderful Python-based course in dynamic macroeconomic theory. 
We've used a lot of their material, as well as their approach to documentation.  
We thank them for that, and for their advice and encouragement.
