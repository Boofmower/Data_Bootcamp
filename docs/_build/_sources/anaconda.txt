Getting started with Python
---------------------------

**Python.**  Python is a popular general-purpose programming language that has been used 
for a broad range of applications.  
Dropbox, for example, is written entirely in Python.  

We'll use Python to study economic and financial data, but the same methods 
-- and more -- can be applied to data from any source.  
One of our former students is using it to study patterns of 
`survival on the Titanic <http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted>'. Another is using it to 
[process text](http://www.nltk.org/) from analyst reports.  
Thanks to [AQR](http://pandas.pydata.org/community.html#history-of-development) and others, the data analytic toolsets in Python now rival stat-focused languages like R.   

**Python on the Cloud.**
The easiest way to get started with Python is to run it on the Cloud with 
[Wakari](https://wakari.io/).  Just click on the link and sign up for an account.  
In our experience, it's virtually instantaneous.  
Wakari runs what are called IPython Notebooks, which are a combination of Python code and text, 
with the code executable in chunks.  The text allows us to document what we're doing as we go.  
A former student (one who is reasonably tech savvy) writes:  "IPython seems best for beginners. 
The structure almost forces good documentation and you can build the script over time versus building 
and running it all at once."

One downside we've found to this is that the Wakari default uses a older version of Python that 
does not allow some of the cool web tools for data input.  
The interface for Yahoo Options data, for example, doesn't quite work (close, but not quite).  
We can probably tell Wakari to use a newer version, 
or write a workaround for this version, but we're not there yet.  
Another downside is that the server is sometimes too busy to execute your code.  
You'll notice that an asterisk appears to 
the left of the code segment and nothing happens.  Sometimes it goes away shortly, sometimes not.  

If you'd like to give Wakari a try, set up an account and give it a try.  
It's pretty close to self-explanatory.  

**Python on your computer.** We find this more user-friendly, but it's trickier to set up initially.  
Here's what's involved:  

*Step 1: Download and install the Anaconda distribution of Python.*  Anaconda is a combination of 
basic Python and toolsets called packages -- what aficionados call a "code distribution."  
Anaconda has all the basics and covers most of what we plan to do.  
It has options for most operating systems (Windows, Mac OS, Linux, all of various vintages) 
and versions of Python (we use version 3.4).  Follow these steps:      

* Download the installer. Click on [this link](http://continuum.io/downloads).  
  Below the words "Download Anaconda" you'll see in caps:  "CHOOSE YOUR INSTALLER."  
  To the right you'll see three logos and the words "I WANT PYTHON 3.4."  
  First, choose your computer's operating system by clicking on the appropriate logo 
  (window panes, apple, or penguin).  
  The site usually guesses this, which you can tell because it will be blue rather than gray.  
  Second, click on "I WANT PYTHON 3.4."  
  Yup, only the newest and best for you!  
  Finally, immediately below the words "CHOOSE YOUR INSTALLER" 
  you'll see a box with words like "[Op System] 64-bit / Python 3.4 / Graphical Installer."  
  Click on it to download the installer.  

* Install Python.  Once you've downloaded the installer, click on it and follow instructions.  
  This is no different from any other installation you've done.  

*Step 2:  Running Python.* You should now have Python on your computer.  
There are two standard ways to run Python:   

* Spyder. Our preferred method is to run Python in Spyder.  We'd like to say:  
  Start it up as you would any program.  
  That's intentionally glib, we've had difficulty finding the on button in some environments, 
  but there's no single solution, every operating system is different.  
  In Windows 7, for example, installation usually puts a Spyder icon on the desktop. 
  Click on it and you're good to go.  
  In Windows 8.1, we managed to locate Spyder in the apps, but it's well hidden.  

* Spyder, continued.  Once you get Spyder going, you'll have a pretty standard graphical user interface, 
  similar to what you'd have with Matlab or R (RStudio, for example).  
  There's an editor, typically on the left, where you can write and edit code.  
  There are buttons at the top for running it.  
  There's an IPython console where you can try out commands or ask for help.  
  We'll do a lot of this, but not right now.    

* IPython.  To create or run an IPython Notebook, you need to do something like:  
  go to the command line and type 'ipython notebook'. 
  If it works, it will look a lot like Wakari, 
  but you'll be running IPython on your computer with whatever version of Python you have installed.  
  As with Spyder, getting it going is harder in some systems than others.  Good luck!      

**Advice.** There's a steep learning curve at the start of any effort like this.  
You'll get through it in time, but it takes patience and persistence  We suggest:

* Take your time.  This won't happen overnight.  But it won't take weeks, either, 
  before you're doing cool things.  

* Ask for help.  This is much easier to do if you have friends doing the same thing.  
  Or even better, friends who are ahead of you.  You'll probably find you need a lot of help at the start, 
  but once you get going you'll be able to help yourself.  

* Google fu.  Once you've made some progress, you can learn a lot just by Googling your issue.  
  The best links are often the Python documentation and Stack Overflow.  

* Start from templates.  The easiest place to start is with programs that work.  
  Start with one and tweak it till you get what you want.  The documentation includes lots of examples.  
  And we'll have examples of our own.  

**Wordplay.** Python is named for Monty Python.  
Idle, a well-know Python editor, is a reference to Eric Idle.  
The Python Package Index, a repository of packages, 
is commonly known as the [CheeseShop](http://youtu.be/PPN3KTtrnZM).  
Anaconda is, of course, a play on the snake theme.
