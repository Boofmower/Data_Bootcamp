<p>Current version of this material:  <a class="reference external" href="http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~dbackus/bootcamp/">http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~dbackus/bootcamp/</a></p>
<p>We hope to host this on GitHub but we&#8217;re not there yet.

(What&#8217;s there now is not up to date.)</p>
<p>We have students every term who would like to get some programming experience,
which they think will expand their career opportunities.
As one student put it:  &#8220;I can do most things in Excel, but I don&#8217;t think that will be true in five years.&#8221;
We think they&#8217;re right.
Excel is fine, but for lots of data applications Python offers a more powerful and efficient platform.
In economic terms:  learning Python is a significant investment, but once you&#8217;ve made it
the marginal cost of data work will be a lot lower.</p>
<p>We developed (or rather, are developing) this document with the idea
of teaching a data courses at NYU Stern that uses Python to study economic, financial, and business data.
It&#8217;s intended for classroom use;
if you try to work through it on your own you&#8217;ll probably find it somewhat mysterious.
And probably even more mysterious than that because it&#8217;s work in progress.
We&#8217;re posting it now only because we&#8217;re doing an informal version for a few interested students.</p>
<p>Comments welcome on all of this:  the idea, the execution, the details.</p>
<div class="section" id="course-description">
<h2>Course description<a class="headerlink" href="#course-description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Data Bootcamp is about nuts and bolts data analysis.
You will learn about economic, financial, and business data and
enough about computer programming to make sense of it.
Applications include some or all of:  leading economic indicators; country indicators;
bond and equity returns; stock options; income by zip code; “long tail” sales data;
innovation diffusion curves; attendance data for plays and sports teams; and many others.
We will use Python, a popular high-level computer language that’s widely used in finance, consulting,
and other parts of the business world.  “High-level” means that it’s less painful than most
(the hard work is done by the language and its collection of tools),
but it’s a serious language with extensive capabilities.
“Analysis” means primarily graphical descriptions that summarize the
properties of data in ways that are helpful to managers.
“Bootcamp” is a reminder that you should come willing to work.
It will be worth it, but there&#8217;s no way to avoid doing some work.</p>

<h2>Answers to questions<a class="headerlink" href="#answers-to-questions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Why take this course?</em></p>
<p>It’s an investment in your future.
You will be able to process data and communicate its content much
more efficiently than with a spreadsheet program.
And that’s a huge understatement.  After this course, you will be more valuable to
current and future employers &#8211; and Excel will remind you of doing arithmetic on your fingers.</p>
<p><em>What are the prerequisites?</em></p>
<p>There are none, other than the courage to take on a challenge
and the patience to debug programs that don’t quite work &#8211; and they never work the first time,
and often not the second or third time either.  The course is designed for students with little or no programming experience.
We will teach you what you need to know.</p>
<p><em>Are you exaggerating about patience?</em></p>
<p>No. If you don&#8217;t have it, you should do something else.
But if you stick with it, you&#8217;ll have more power over information than you did before.
Even so, you&#8217;ll occasionally run into
<a class="reference external" href="http://junkcharts.typepad.com/numbersruleyourworld/2011/11/three-hours-in-the-life-of-a-glorified-data-scientist.html">situations that challenge your sanity</a>.
Remember,
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fu_(TV_series)#Overview">grasshopper</a>,
enlightenment comes from working through challenges and overcoming them.</p>
<p><em>Where will this lead?</em></p>
<p>This course won&#8217;t turn you into a quant.
But it will turn you into someone who can work well with quants and &#8211;
together with the rest of the program &#8211; communicate effectively with executives.
You will come out somewhere between Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill in
“<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film)">Moneyball</a>,&#8221;
with a solid foundation for dealing with whatever data comes your way in business or life.
You will also be well prepared to do more along similar lines, including the extensive collection
of courses on business analytics and data science offered by our
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.stern.nyu.edu/experience-stern/about/departments-centers-initiatives/academic-departments/ioms-dept/">IOMS group</a>.
It&#8217;s cool stuff, you should check it out.</p>
<p><em>Should I take this course if I already know how to code?</em></p>
<p>Probably not, there are more advanced options that would suit you better.
If you take it anyway, please don’t scare the other students.</p>

<p>And worth every cent.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a steep learning curve at the start of any effort like this.
You&#8217;ll get through it, but it takes patience and persistence.
Some suggestions:</p>
<p><em>Take your time.</em>  This won&#8217;t happen overnight.  But it won&#8217;t take weeks, either,
before you&#8217;re doing cool things.</p>
<p><em>Work with others.</em>  This is much easier to do if you have friends doing the same thing.
Or even better, friends who are ahead of you.  You&#8217;ll probably find that you need a lot of help at the start,
but once you get going you&#8217;ll be able to help yourself.</p>
<p><em>Google fu.</em>  Once you&#8217;ve made some progress, you can learn a lot just by Googling your issue.
Things like:  &#8220;python read spreadsheet.&#8221;
The best links are often the
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/">Python tutorial</a> (it&#8217;s really good) and
<a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python">Stack Overflow</a>
(the go-to place for code questions).</p>
<p><em>Start from examples.</em>  The easiest place to start is with programs that work.
Start with one  and tweak it till you get what you want.
Play around with the details and see what happens.
The documentation includes lots of examples.
And we&#8217;ll have lots of examples of our own.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements<a class="headerlink" href="#acknowledgements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We owe big thank-you&#8217;s to Chase Coleman and Spencer Lyon, aka Sargent&#8217;s Python Team, and Paul Backus;
they&#8217;re our go-to advisors on technical issues.
Sarah Beckett-Hile is rapidly adding to our collection of applications
and proves that English majors can code as well as anyone.
You may also notice a resemblance to Tom Sargent and John Stachurski&#8217;s
<a class="reference external" href="http://quant-econ.net/">Quantitative Economics</a>,
a wonderful Python-based course in dynamic macroeconomic theory.
We&#8217;ve used a lot of their material, as well as their approach to documentation.
We thank them for that, and for their advice and encouragement.</p>
