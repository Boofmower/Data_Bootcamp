<span id="tut-install"></span><h1>Installing Python<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-python" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>There are lots of ways to install and use Python, but we recommend one.
We&#8217;ll mention two, but we recommend just one.
Don&#8217;t get cute, just follow these instructions.</p>
<div class="section" id="python-on-the-cloud">
<span id="tut-wakari"></span><h2>Python on the cloud<a class="headerlink" href="#python-on-the-cloud" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The easiest way to get started with Python is to run it on the cloud with
<a class="reference external" href="https://wakari.io/">Wakari</a>.
Just click on the link and sign up for an account.
In our experience, it&#8217;s virtually instantaneous.
Wakari runs IPython Notebooks, which are a combination of Python code and text,
with the code executable in chunks.  The text allows us to document what we&#8217;re doing as we go.
A former student (one who is reasonably tech savvy) writes:  &#8220;IPython seems best for beginners.
The structure almost forces good documentation and you can build the script over time versus building
and running it all at once.&#8221;  That&#8217;s not our view, but it&#8217;s a reasonable one.</p>
<p>One downside is that the Wakari default uses an older version of Python that
does not allow some of the newer web tools for data input.
The interface for Yahoo Options data, for example, doesn&#8217;t quite work (close, but not quite).
We can probably tell Wakari to use a newer version,
or write a workaround for this version, but we&#8217;re not there yet.
Another downside is that the server is sometimes too busy to execute your code.
An asterisk appears to the left of the code segment and nothing happens.
Sometimes it goes away, sometimes not.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to give Wakari a try, set up an account.
It&#8217;s pretty close to self-explanatory.</p>

<h2>Python on your computer<a class="headerlink" href="#python-on-your-computer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We prefer to run Python with Spyder, but it&#8217;s trickier to set up.
Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s involved:</p>
<p><em>Step 1. Download and install the Anaconda distribution of Python.</em></p>
<p>Anaconda is a combination of
basic Python and toolsets called packages &#8211; what aficionados call a &#8220;code distribution.&#8221;
Anaconda has all the basics and covers almost all of what we plan to do.
It has options for most operating systems (Windows, Mac OS, Linux, all of various vintages)
and versions of Python (we use version 3.4).
To install it, follow these steps:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Download the installer.</em> Click on
<a class="reference external" href="http://continuum.io/downloads">this link</a>.
Below the words &#8220;Download Anaconda&#8221; you&#8217;ll see in caps:  &#8220;CHOOSE YOUR INSTALLER.&#8221;
To the right you&#8217;ll see three logos and the words &#8220;I WANT PYTHON 3.4.&#8221;
First, choose your computer&#8217;s operating system by clicking on the appropriate logo
(window panes, apple, or penguin).
The site usually guesses this, which you can tell because the appropriate logo
will be blue rather than gray.
Second, click on &#8220;I WANT PYTHON 3.4.&#8221;
Yup, only the newest and best for you!
Finally, immediately below the words &#8220;CHOOSE YOUR INSTALLER&#8221;
you&#8217;ll see a box with words like &#8220;[Op System] 64-bit / Python 3.4 / Graphical Installer.&#8221;
Click on it to download the installer.  |</li>
<li><em>Install Python.</em>  Once you&#8217;ve downloaded the installer, click on it and follow the instructions.
This is no different from any other installation you&#8217;ve done.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Step 2:  Run Python.</em></p>
<p>You should now have Python on your computer.
There are two ways to run it, Spyder (recommended) and IPython (same as Wakari, but on your computer):</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Spyder!!!</strong>
You might guess from the exclamation points that this is our preferred method.  And it is.
We&#8217;d like to say:  &#8220;Start it up as you would any program&#8221; but we haven&#8217;t found it that easy.
In some environments we&#8217;ve had difficulty finding the on button, perhaps through our own incompetence.
There doesn&#8217;t seem to be a one-size-fits-all solution, every operating system is different.
In Windows 7, for example, installation usually puts a Spyder icon on the desktop.
Click on it and you&#8217;re good to go.
In Windows 8.1, we managed to locate Spyder in the apps, but it&#8217;s well hidden and took us a while.</p>
<p>Once you get Spyder running, you&#8217;ll have a pretty standard graphical user interface,
similar to what you&#8217;d have with Matlab or R (RStudio, for example).
There&#8217;s an editor on the left, where you can write and edit code.
There are buttons at the top for running it.
There&#8217;s an IPython console where you can try out commands or get help.  And so on.
More later.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>IPython.</em>  To create or run an IPython notebook, you need to do something like:
go to the command line and type &#8216;ipython notebook&#8217;.
This will open a tab in your browser where you can write and execute IPython notebooks.
The opening screen is a directory, but you can open a new or old notebook
and navigate through the directory and save it wherever you like.
It will look like Wakari,
but you&#8217;ll be running IPython on your computer with whatever version of Python you have installed.
As with Spyder, getting it going is harder in some systems than others.  Good luck!</p>

The basics of the language presented in a user-friendly way.
Start up Python and copy what they do there.
Note, too, the box in the upper left corner for the version of Python you&#8217;re using.
We&#8217;ll stick with Version 3.4 for now, but the major differences are between Python 2.x
and 3x.  Avoid 2.x unless you really know what you&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/">Spyder interface</a>.
We&#8217;ll go over this in class, but you can skim through the documentation yourself.
The key components:  (i) On the left is an editor where you write programs.
(ii) In the lower right corner, there&#8217;s what they call an IPython console, where you can type
in commands one at a time to see what they do.
(iii) In the upper right corner there&#8217;s what they call the Object inspector, which gives you access
to documentation about specific commands.  Type in the command and its documentation pops up.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/interactive/tutorial.html">IPython tutorial</a>.
We recommend you use Spyder.  If you want to run code in small chunks, you can do that.
But if you nevertheless decide to use IPython, here&#8217;s where you start.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://quant-econ.net/py/learning_python.html">Quant Econ</a>.
The Sargent-Stachurski Quantitative Economics site has a really nice introduction
to Python.  It covers much of what we&#8217;ll do, but in a relatively terse way.
Their emphasis is on macroeconomic theory, but the early sections touch on data work.
We&#8217;ll do the same in (much) more detail.</p>
