**Acknowledgements.**
This was Glenn Okun's idea, so I should probably thank him, although he really should have done this himself.  I do appreciate his support.  And I know I should thank Chase Coleman and Spencer Lyon, aka Tom Sargent's Python Team, and Paul Backus; they're our go-to advisors on technical issues.  Sarah Beckett-Hile is rapidly adding to our collection of applications and verifies that English majors can code as well as anyone.  You may also notice a resemblance to Tom Sargent and John Stachurski's [Quantitative Economics](http://quant-econ.net/), a wonderful Python-based course in dynamic macroeconomic theory. We've used a lot of their material, including their approach to documentation.  We thank them for that, and for their advice and encouragement.
