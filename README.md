**Suggestions welcome.**  Post them at the "Issues" link to the right (look for the exclamation point in a circle) or email Dave Backus at NYU:  db3@nyu.edu. Thanks in advance. 

**Acknowledgements.**
This was Glenn Okun's idea, so I should probably thank him, although he really should have done this himself.  I do appreciate his support.  And I know I should thank Chase Coleman and Spencer Lyon, aka Tom Sargent's Python Team, and Paul Backus; they're our go-to advisors on technical issues.  Sarah Beckett-Hile is rapidly adding to our collection of applications and is proof that English majors can code as well as anyone.  You may also notice a resemblance to Tom Sargent and John Stachurski's [Quantitative Economics](http://quant-econ.net/), a wonderful Python-based course in dynamic macroeconomic theory. We've used a lot of their material, including their approach to documentation.  We thank them for that, and for their advice and encouragement.  

**Licensing.** We encourage others to use this material and to acknowledged such use.

###SQL Bootcamp

Temporary home of a non-credit course on SQL databases via Python.  Sarah Beckett-Hile will lead several Friday afternoon sessions to give students and alums a head start on an increasingly valuable business skill.  This follows a popular Python course run last fall.  

**Sessions.** Class sessions will be held on Fridays in KMC 5-90, 2pm to 5pm, starting March 27 and running (prospectively) through April 24.  

**Before the first class.**  We'll be using the Anaconda distribution of Python 3.4. 
To install it on your computer, follow [these instructions](http://davebackus.github.io/Data_Bootcamp/install.html#python-on-your-computer).
If you get stumped, come 30 minutes early to our first session.  

**Materials.**  Links coming.

**Alumni access.** We will post a url shortly for those interested in following the webcast.
