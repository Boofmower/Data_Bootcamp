###Data Bootcamp

Materials for a future course using Python to study economic and financial data with graphical methods. Current draft of sales pitch:

>**Description.** This course is about the analysis of data.  You will learn about economic, financial, and business data and the fundamentals of computer programming needed to make sense of it.  Applications include some or all of:  GDP and it components; leading economic indicators; labor market indicators; emerging market indicators; bond and equity returns; stock options; income by zip code; “long tail” sales data; innovation diffusion curves; attendance data for plays and sports teams; and many others.  We will use Python, a popular high-level computer language that’s widely used in finance, consulting, and other parts of the business world.  “High-level” means that it’s less painful than most (the hard work is done by the language and its collection of tools), but it’s a serious language with extensive capabilities.  “Analysis of data” means primarily graphical descriptions that summarize the properties of data in ways that are helpful to managers.  “Bootcamp” is a reminder that you should come willing to work. 

>**Why should you take this course?**  It’s an investment in your future.  You will be able to process data and communicate its content much more efficiently than with a spreadsheet program.  And that’s a huge understatement.  After this course, you will be more valuable to current and future employers -- and Excel will remind you of doing arithmetic on your fingers.  

>**What are the prerequisites?**  There are none, other than the courage to take on a challenge and the patience to debug programs that don’t quite work -- and they never work the first time, and often not the second or third either.  The course is designed for students with little or no programming experience.  We will teach you what you need to know.  

>**Are you exaggerating about patience?** No. If you don't have it, you should do something else.  You'll have more power over information than you did before, but you'll also run into [situations that challenge your sanity] (http://junkcharts.typepad.com/numbersruleyourworld/2011/11/three-hours-in-the-life-of-a-glorified-data-scientist.html). But remember, [grasshopper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwai_Chang_Caine), 
that enlightenment comes from working through difficult situations and overcoming them.  

>**Where will this lead?**  You will come out of the course somewhere between Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill in 
“[Moneyball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film))," with a solid foundation for dealing with whatever data comes up in your business or life.  You will also be well prepared to do more along similar lines, including the extensive collection of courses on business analytics and data science offered by our 
[IOMS group](http://www.stern.nyu.edu/experience-stern/about/departments-centers-initiatives/academic-departments/ioms-dept/).  It's cool stuff, you should check it out.    

>**Should you take this course if you already know how to code?**  Probably not, there are more advanced options that would suit you better.  If you take it anyway, please don’t scare the other students.  

This is work in progress.  Working examples are posted in the Code directory.  Suggestions welcome: either post them at the "Issues" link on the upper right or email me:  db3@nyu.edu (Dave Backus @ NYU). Thanks in advance. 

**Acknowledgements.**
This was Glenn Okun's idea, so I should probably thank him, although he really should have done this himself.  I do appreciate his support.  And I know I should thank Chase Coleman and Spencer Lyon, aka Tom Sargent's Python Team, and Paul Backus.  They're responsible for most of what I've done here, either directly or indirectly.
