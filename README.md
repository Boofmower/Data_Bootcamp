###Data_Bootcamp

Materials for a future course using Python to study economic and financial data with graphical methods. Current draft of sales pitch:

>This course is about the analysis of data.  You will learn about economic, financial, and business data and the fundamentals of computer programming needed to make sense of it.  Examples include GDP; leading economic indicators; labor market indicators; emerging market indicators; bond and equity returns; income by zip code; “long tail” sales data; innovation diffusion curves; attendance data for plays and sports teams; and many others.  We will use Python, a popular high-level computer language that’s widely used in finance, consulting, and other parts of the business world.  “High-level” means that it’s less painful than most (the hard work is done by the language and its collection of tools), but it’s a serious language with extensive capabilities.  “Analysis of data” means primarily graphical descriptions that summarize the properties of data in ways that are helpful to managers.  “Bootcamp” is a reminder that you should come willing to work.
