###Data Bootcamp

Materials for a course about economic, financial, and business data.  The course uses the Python programming language and is targetted at programming newbies who would like to get some programming experience and develop their quantitative skills.  Students with prior programming experience will learn about data:  where to find it, what to do with it.

**Acknowledgements.**
This was Glenn Okun's idea, so I should probably thank him, although he really should have done this himself.  I do appreciate his support.  And I know I should thank Chase Coleman and Spencer Lyon, aka Tom Sargent's Python Team, and Paul Backus; they're our go-to advisors on technical issues.  Sarah Beckett-Hile is rapidly adding to our collection of applications and is proof that English majors can code as well as anyone.  You may also notice a resemblance to Tom Sargent and John Stachurski's [Quantitative Economics](http://quant-econ.net/), a wonderful Python-based course in dynamic macroeconomic theory. We've used a lot of their material, including their approach to documentation.  We thank them for that, and for their advice and encouragement.
