###Data Bootcamp

Materials for a course about economic, financial, and business data based on the Python programming language.  It is designed to give (i) students some familiarity with economic and financial data and its uses and (ii) programming newbies a sense of how modern software makes life easier and more interesting.

**Suggestions welcome.**  Post them at the "Issues" link to the right (look for the exclamation point in a circle) or email Dave Backus at NYU:  db3@nyu.edu. Thanks in advance. 

**Acknowledgements.**
This was Glenn Okun's idea, so I should probably thank him, although he really should have done this himself.  I do appreciate his support.  And I know I should thank Chase Coleman and Spencer Lyon, aka Tom Sargent's Python Team, and Paul Backus; they're our go-to advisors on technical issues.  Sarah Beckett-Hile is rapidly adding to our collection of applications and is proof that English majors can code as well as anyone.  You may also notice a resemblance to Tom Sargent and John Stachurski's [Quantitative Economics](http://quant-econ.net/), a wonderful Python-based course in dynamic macroeconomic theory. We've used a lot of their material, including their approach to documentation.  We thank them for that, and for their advice and encouragement.  

**Licensing.** We encourage others to use this material and to acknowledged such use.

###SQL Bootcamp

Professors David Backus and Glenn Okun proudly present the NYU Stern School of Business SQL Bootcamp. This five-session non-credit program will be taught by Sarah Beckett-Hile. It follows a popular
[Python course](https://nyusterneconomics.wordpress.com/2014/10/27/business-students-learn-to-code/) run last fall.  

**Sessions.** Class sessions will be held on Fridays in KMC 5-90, 2pm to 5pm, starting March 27 and running (prospectively) through April 24.  

**Before the first class.**  We'll be using the Anaconda distribution of Python 3.4. 
To install it on your computer, follow [these instructions](http://davebackus.github.io/Data_Bootcamp/install.html#python-on-your-computer).
If you're stumped, come 30 minutes early to our first session.  

**Webcast.**  We have set up a "webinar" for people who cannot be here in person.  
Please register [here](https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/3554985340709263362) 
for SQL Bootcamp at NYU Stern School of Business. 
After registering, you will receive a confirmation email with information about joining the webinar.

**Materials.**  Links coming.

**Posting questions.** If you have questions during the course, please post them on our
[discussion board](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nyu_data_bootcamp), a Google group devoted to this purpose.  (Follow the directions to join if you haven't already.)
